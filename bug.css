The CSS specificity rules can sometimes lead to unexpected results.  For example, consider the following styles:

```css
div p { color: blue; }
.special p { color: red; }
div.special p { color: green; }
```

A `<div class="special"><p>This is some text</p></div>` element would be green, because the most specific selector (`div.special p`) wins.  However, it might not be obvious why this is the case or that a seemingly less specific selector is being overridden.
